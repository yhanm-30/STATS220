## Introduction

Welcome to my STATS 220 Assignment 1 page. For my assignment, I have used R to create a meme about inflation as it is very topical at the moment due to prices increasing for many everyday products. To create my meme, I have obtained some pictures online that help explain how inflation affects people. I have used the magick package within R to combine pictures and blank images with writing together into one overall image.

## My meme

I have created a meme about inflation and its impacts as it is a topical issue at the moment. It is more educational than funny, but hopefully will give readers an idea of the basic impacts of inflation on everyday life. **For more information** about inflation, please visit the [Reserve Bank of New Zealand website](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/monetary-policy/inflation).
